# SCTweetAlchemy
SCTweetAlchemy is a specialized utility for SuperCollider live coding performers. It allows users to browse, filter, and manage a collection of "SCTweets" - compact SuperCollider code snippets originally designed to fit within Twitter's character limits.
Key functionality includes:

Browse and Filter: Users can search for specific tweets by name and filter them using dropdown categories like Author, UGen type, Sonic Characteristic, and Complexity. The favorites system lets users mark and quickly access their preferred snippets.

View and Study: The interface displays both the original code and metadata (author, tags, description) for each tweet, making it easy to understand what each snippet does before using it.
Planned Features:

Storage of new SCTweets to expand your personal collection
Automatic reformatting of dense SCTweet code into more readable versions for live coding contexts
Seamless integration with various live coding IDEs through automatic copy-paste functionality



This tool serves as a practical library and performance aid for SuperCollider musicians, providing quick access to a diverse collection of sound-generating code snippets that can be rapidly deployed during live performances.
